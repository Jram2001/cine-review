# CINE-REVIEW
 A machine learning model used to predict IMDB movie raing based on score matchbox recommender
# PROJECT DESCRPTION
 By updating the entire status of each movie database,we can predict the movie decision accordingly.so that one could predict which movie is mosted rated.if the movie's viewer count is increasing then the movie review will increases which will be more useful for a new user.this model not only helps the fresh user,it also helps in reducing the man labour work.
# AZURE SERVICES USED
 Azure machine learning studio is used to create, train and evaluate the machine learning model. In Azure machine learning portal, select or import a dataset for the model. After uploading the dataset as CSV file, then select the blocks for the model and then connect and visualize the blocks. The final output will be visualized in the evaluated model

# DETAILED DISCRIPTION:
Create Project/Experiment and import movie rating data set from saved dataset samples. After creating experiment, we need to drag and drop the required modules in canvas.

I have used the below modules for my experiment in the given order




   DATA SET:
 
     Data set required for experiment is added
   
   IMDB MOVIE TITLES:
 
     This data set consists of movie id and movie names.
   
   Editing Metadata:
 
     Used to change data type of fields, etc.
   
   Join data:
 
     Used to join the above two dataset.
   
   Select column in dataset:
 
     Select columns to inclue or exclude from a dataset in an operation.formerly known as project columns.
   
   Remove duplicate rows:
 
     Remove the duplicate rows from a dataset.
   
   Split data:
 
     split the rows of a dataset into two distinct areas,here the dataset is splitted into Train and Score matchbox recommender.
   
   Train matchbox recommender:
 
     Train a bayesian recommender using the matchbox algorithm.
   
   Score matchbox recommender:
 
     It scores a dataset using matchbox recommender.
   
   Evaluate recommender:
 
     this is the final dataset it evaluates and gives the accuracy values 
     this evaluate recommender is used to evaluates a recommender model.
